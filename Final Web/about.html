<!-- <h2>We Do Company Things</h2> -->
<p>I love hiking, skiing, and going on random adventures on the weekends. Bet ya never heard that one before. </p>
<p>I really enjoy taking pictures and have become the "photographer" of my friend group. But more often you'll find me taking pictures of clouds. My friends would say itâ€™s my main personality trait. </p>
<p>If I'm not outside taking pictures of clouds or skiing I'm probably at a hockey rink or inside glued to the tv watching Formula 1.
I have my brother and dad to thank for both of those interests. </p>
<p>According to apple music, I listened to 1,162 hours of music in 2021... let's just say you'll never find me sitting in a silent room.  </p>
