  <li>Competitors race each other up a wall towering 50 feet with 31 holds on it.</li>
  <li>The wall and its holds have been the same for the past 14 years.</li>
  <li>The key is memorizing a path and mastering it.</li>

    <p>Bouldering just uses climbing shoes and a bag of chalk over safety mats, your challenge is to climb short but tricky bouldering "problems" (a route, or sequence of moves) using balance, technique, strength, and your brain.</p>

    <p>In lead climbing, athletes attack a wall thatâ€™s at least 15 meters (49.2 feet) tall. They have only one shot and must wear a harness for safety. The wall is a different puzzle each time, and climbers are kept in isolation ahead of the competition, allowed just a few minutes to study the holds before the clock starts ticking.</p>
    <h4>Brooke finished in <a href="https://www.teamusa.org/usa-climbing/athletes/Brooke-Raboutou">5th place</a> in Combined at the inaugural Sport Climbing event in the Olympic Games.</h4>
