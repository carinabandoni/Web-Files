<h2 class="background">This is a Little More About Me!</h2>
    <p >I’m your basic Boulder girl… I enjoy hiking and skiing on the weekends (bet ya never heard that one before). I really like taking pictures of clouds. It’s my main personality trait. I also really enjoy listening to music, any type, hit me with your best oddly specific playlist. I grew up in vail and moved here in middle school so I call both places home. I love traveling and exploring. My true passion is graphic design, I could sit at my computer for 5 hours on illustrator if I had the time. But I am a very busy girl, I have 2 internships and 2 freelance jobs right now, plus school! So thats about all for now.</p>

<h2 class="background">Here are 5 Places to Take a Photoshoot in Denver</h2>
    <p id="second">
      <ul>
        <li>Union Station</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Union Station has to be one of the most photographable train stations there is. The interior and exterior of the building are both stunning. You can snap a picture in front of the iconic union station sign, or inside at the dainty flower shop. The options here are endless. </li>
          </ul>
        <li>Pastel Row on Colfax Ave</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Pastel Row is a collection of townhomes all painted in vibrant, pastel colors. If you are looking to add some color to your Instagram feed, this is the place for you. </li>
          </ul>
        <li>Red Rocks Amphitheater</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If you’ve ever stepped foot into Colorado, we know you’ve heard of Red Rocks. While it’s 10 miles west of Denver, we HAD to include this iconic spot. Whether its a sunrise photo or selfies from a concert, the photos here are breathtaking. You won’t regret checking out this spot!</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Denver Botanic Gardens</li>
          <ul>
            <li>At the Denver Botanic Gardens, you can explore 24 acres of picture-perfect spots. There is a different photogenic bridge, plant, and gazebo around every corner. You HAVE to stop here if you want a new nature spot to switch up your scenery.  </li>
